due to the nrwl/nx bug, we have to do this to create the libraries:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
run this command, so that the <LIB_NAME> is generated under /dist folder.
    ng build <LIB_NAME> --prod

then move it under /dist/libs folder, then run it again.
